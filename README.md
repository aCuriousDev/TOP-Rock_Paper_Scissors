# TOP-Rock_Paper_Scissors

A simple yet interesting challenge from The Odin Project. The goal is to build a program to plya rock paper scissors against the computer, in five rounds.

##Learning outcomes

- I learned how to generate pseudo-randomness and use it to attribute a value depending on the generated number.
- I learned how to call function, pass argument and use the for loop.
- I also figured out how to display those results in the dom with the use of .innerText and documentGetElementById.
